To add columns to posts or pages, all you need to do to is first choose the column width combinations you want to use with the column width classes below and insert the following HTML into the text editor of your Page or Post  (adjust the HTML below according to your needs):

<div class="one-half first">YOUR FIRST COLUMN CONTENT HERE</div>
<div class="one-half">YOUR SECOND COLUMN CONTENT HERE</div>

Here are the column width classes:

.five-sixths
.four-fifths
.four-sixths
.one-fifth
.one-fourth
.one-half
.one-sixth
.one-third
.three-fifths
.three-fourths
.three-sixths
.two-fifths
.two-fourths
.two-sixths
.two-thirds

The other important class is the class called first. It is important to always add the .first class to the left-most column as this then forces a new row.
